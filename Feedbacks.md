Ilan,

You did a very impressive project — your choice was ambitious and you executed it beautifully.
Your code is clean, readable, and very well structured. 
I especially appreciate the comments you added to each function and step; they make it much easier to quickly understand your logic and decisions.

You successfully used all the features we learned in class, and even went beyond that — great work, this makes your Hackathon project very complete. 
The UI is also clean and easy to use, which adds a lot to the overall experience.

Excellent job — keep up the great work!
